What is computer?
====================
Laptop
Mobile
Phone
Refrigerator
Washing machine etc..

We can call above all those also a computer because A computer has some characterstics like CPU,RAM,STORAGE etc. And when we connect these devices to internet a IP address will be created to operate the computer (or) to compute with in the local and worldwide

www.facebook.com ---> is a Server. based on the purpose like
TV is used for Channels
Mobile is user for calls
Similarly Server is used for hosting applications and serve users/clients


Client-Server Architecture
=============================
Client = who is requesting information
Server = who is giving information

Example:-Phone and laptop "viceversa"
Whole IT is communication between clinets and servers


Operating systems
=====================
Windows OS ---> A bridge between user and hardware 
User instructions ---> commands ---> 0/1 ---> hardware

OS will takcare of converting 0's and 1's 


Windows vs Linux
===================
Windows ---> Graphics(Load increases on CPU,memory everthing)
Linux ---> Linix world(No graphics,Faster,relabile,lesscost,stability,security comes from unix principles only


How to connect Linux servers?
=================================
BOX = linux server (or) node
LOCK = public key(should be in aws(sevrer)
KEY = private key(should be with you)

Authentication mechanisms to connect linux server
===================================================
1.what you know ---> username and password
2.what you have ---> rsa tokens
3.what you are  ---> palms,retina,fingerprints etc. for now we use second method (what you have),so we use SSH(secure shell)

So here we need to generate or create a link between "LOCK and KEY" by using a command in gitbash "ssh-keygen -f <filename>" and press enter two times so there will be two files generated ".pub" and "without extension" to unable extension go to 
controlpanel ---> file explorer options ---> view ---> unhide extensions for known files and then rename your private key with ".pem"

Syntax for publickey is = ssh-rsa <code> Laptopname
Syntax for privatekey is = BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY <code> END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY


So you have created a link now create a server in aws and connect to that server with these key

Steps:-
==========
1.Import keypair in aws by going to --> Network and security options --> keypairs --> actions --> import key pair without any gaps
2.Create a security group(firewall) for inbound -->all traffic-->0.0.0.0/0(representation of internet)
3.Launch instance with keypairs and take Amazon Linux 2AMI(HVM)

Take public IP and username is "ec2-user" and "privatekey"
{ssh -i <path-to-privatekey> username@IP} === usage {ssh -i saikiran.pem ec2-user@123.23.234.5}

Gitbash ---> ssh client
Protocol ---> ssh(we have different protocols like https,http etc.)
Port ----> 22
Ec2 server ---> ssh server


Absolute path and Relative path
====================================
1.Absolute path === ssh -i /c/users/user/saikiran.pem ec2-user@IP (if you dont know where you are so give from the starting)
2.Relative path === just know where you are by PWD and then give the path from there 

Where ever you are if you type CD and enter you will go to user directory
clear command will clear all the lines

$---> normal user
#---> root user(sudo su) to exit from root just "exit"
pwd---> present working directory you will be launched to /home/ec2-user
uname---> will tell the kernel name
<command-name> --help ---> help

us-east-1 ---> is the cheapest region,every region has min 2 availability zones,eberything here we call has resources,EC2(sevrer)


Linux is not OS it is a kernel(49:35 to 58:38)
====================================================






============================================================================================================================================================


Overview
-----------

1.ssh-keygen -f <file-name> ---> to generate key , and make sure you create in the home folder just go to home folder by "cd" and then create
2.ssh -i <path-to-privatekey> username@IP ---> to connect to the server
