What is computer ?
-------------------
Laptop,Mobile,Phone,Refrigerator,Washing machine etc. We can call these also a computer because a 
computer has some characterstics like CPU,RAM,STORAGE etc. and when we connect these devices to 
Internet(WiFi) an IPaddress will be created to operate the computer (or) to compute with in the local 
and worldwide from anywhere in the world.

www.facebook.com ---> is a Server, Based on the purpose like below
TV ---> is used for Broadcasting
Mobile ---> is used for calls
Server ---> is used for Hosting web applications to serve users (or) clients

Client-Server Architecture
---------------------------
Client ---> Who is requesting information
Server ---> Who is giving information
Example:- Phone and laptop is "viceversa" when transferring media 
Therefore whole IT is communication between clients and servers

Operating systems
------------------
Windows OS ---> A bridge between User and Hardware 
User instructions will turn into ---> Commands turn into ---> 0/1 ---> Hardware
OS will takcare of converting 0's and 1's

Windows vs Linux
-----------------
Windows ---> Graphics(Load increases on CPU,memory & everthing)
Linux ---> Servers world(No graphics,Faster,reliable,lesscost,stability,security comes from 
unix principles only)

How to connect to Linux servers ?
----------------------------------
BOX = Linux server (or) Node
LOCK = Public key(should be in aws-server)
KEY = Private key(should be with you)

Authentication mechanisms to connect linux server
--------------------------------------------------
1. What you know ---> Username and Password
2. What you have ---> RSA tokens
3. What you are  ---> Palms,retina,fingerprints etc. as of now we use second method,so we 
   use SSH(secure shell)

So here we need to generate (or) create a link between "LOCK and KEY" by using a command in gitbash 
"ssh-keygen -f <filename>" and press enter two times, so there will be two files generated ".pub" and 
one more file with the same name but "without extension" to unable extension go to controlpanel
File explorer options ---> View ---> Unhide extensions for known files and then rename your private key 
with ".pem" and the syntax for the keys are below
# Syntax for Publickey is ===> ssh-rsa <code> Laptop-name
# Syntax for Privatekey is ===> BEGIN OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY <code> END OPENSSH PRIVATE KEY
So you have created a link now create a server in aws and connect to that server with these keys

Steps to connect to SSH-server with keys in the gitbash 
--------------------------------------------------------
1. Import keypair in aws by going to --> Network and security options --> Keypairs --> Actions and 
   Import key pair(Publickey) without any gaps
2. Create a Security group(Firewall) for inbound ---> All traffic ---> 0.0.0.0/0 (Representation 
   of internet)
3. Launch instance with keypairs and take Amazon Linux 2AMI(HVM)

Take PublicIP of the instance and username is "ec2-user" (or) Centos and "Privatekey"
{ssh -i <path-to-privatekey> username@IP} ===> Usage {ssh -i saikiran.pem ec2-user@123.23.234.5} and 
this command should be enter in the gitbash in the pwd "c/Users/saikiran"
[Note:- Use Centos as username not ec2-user ---> ssh -i saikiran.pem centos@123.23.234.5]

Gitbash ---> is an ssh client and also a mini linux
Protocol ---> we have different protocols like https,http etc.
Port number for SSH ---> 22
Ec2 server ---> SSH server

Cheapest region is "us-east-1" ---> Latency is somewhat slow which is negligible. Every region has min 2 availability zones, Everything here we call as resources, like EC2(Server). Where ever you are if you type 
CD and enter you will go to User directory. "clear" command will clear all the lines, when you open gitbash bydefault you will be landed in the "/c/Users/saikiran" lcoation and when ever you stuck in the gitbash 
just enter "ctrl+c"

Absolute path and Relative path
--------------------------------
1. Absolute path ===> ssh -i /c/users/user/saikiran.pem ec2-user@IP
   (If you dont know where you are then you can give from the starting)
2. Relative path ===> Just know where you are by PWD and then give the path from there like 
   "ssh -i saikiran.pem ec2-user@IP" when you are in user directory

$ ---> Normal user
# ---> Root user(sudo su -) to exit from root just "exit"
pwd ---> Present working directory you will be launched in /home/ec2-user
uname ---> Will tell the kernel name
<command-name> --help ---> Get help from that particular command
Or you can get help from man command also ---> "man <command-name>"

Linux is not OS it is a kernel(49:35 to 58:38)

Points to remember
*******************
1. HTTP --> 80 Hypertext Transfer Protocol (unencrypted web traffic)
2. HTTPS --> 443 Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure (encrypted web traffic)
3. SSH --> 22 Secure Shell (secure remote login and file transfer)
4. SMTP --> 25 Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (sending email)
5. DNS --> 53 Domain Name System (resolving domain names to IP addresses)
