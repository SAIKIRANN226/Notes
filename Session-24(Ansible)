Ansible vault
--------------
We are giving the passwords in the terminal but it is unsecure for this now we are using vault in the ansible
nothing but storage of secrets, for example below 
encoding ---> A proper pattern to encode the text, in this everybody can guess the secret
encryption ---> Generating a text randomly with mathematic algorithm, so we encrypt ansible vault, so those 
who know the password they can only dycrypt

How to create ansible vault ?
------------------------------
ansible-vault create /path/some-name.yaml

Points to remember
*******************
1. We use ansible.cfg to minimize the commands while running the script in server 
2. If esc is nor working while saving the file you can use ctrl+esc button
