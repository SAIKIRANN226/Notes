Service management(Example posting a letter from Delhi --> Hyd) --> 05:40
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Watch from 05:40, We have 0-65,535 ports are there in computer including mobiles(Consider 
it is apartment), If you dont give port number it will halt at the apartment(0-65,535 ports),
We have different blocks in apartment like ssh(22),http(80),https(443),msql(3306),SMTP(25),like popular protocols and ports nginx is http protocol port no.80, Search for popular protocols in google and 
know about them

Example of how the system (or) linux server is connecting ?
------------------------------------------------------------
ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@IPaddress
1. First request will reach to IPaddress
2. System will check user is connecting to which protocol ? like anything running ssh process
   with port no.22
3. Then it will check the user and privatekey is correct or not ? (or) authentication will be
   checked by system
4. If authentication is passed then we able to connect to it

Example of how we connect to www.facebook.com:443 ?
----------------------------------------------------
1. First request go to fb ipaddress
2. System will check any https process is running in 443 or not ?
3. If running login page will be showed

Algorithm for connecting to instance
-------------------------------------
1. Keygenerate
2. Import publickey
3. Firewall
4. Instance created
5. Connected
If we follow algorithm troubleshooting will be easy nothing but writing yourself in a 
notes in general language

1. Install nginx "sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y" ---> Package installing
2. "systemctl start nginx" ---> This how running a package into a service
3. "systemctl status nginx"---> To know if it is running or not (or) we can also check with
   process, "ps -ef | grep nginx"
4. "systemctl stop nginx"---> To stop the service
5. "systemctl enable nginx"---> Automatically services will run
6. "systemctl disable nginx" ---> Will disable nginx

Network managment
------------------
Network statistics "netstat -lntp"
   l ---> Listing means ports waiting for connections,
   n ---> Shows IPaddresses instead of hostnames (or) services, 
   t ---> Shows only TCP connections ignore UDP,
   p ---> Shows the process ID (PID) and the name of the program that is using the socket.
If netstat is not installed then install it,this command is used to check if ports are running (or) not.
"sudo yum install net-tools". To check their process also then take "sudo netstat -lntp". To check 
wether the netstat is installed (or) not ? Just enter "netstat"

Trouble shooting process
-------------------------
1. Check system resources like 
   CPU memory high consumption ---> Generally we check this in task manager, But in terminal 
   just "top" command
   hardisk full ---> "df -hT"
   RAM full ---> "free --help" If ram is using more and more we need to kill it and restart
2. Check if the process is running or not ? ---> "ps -ef | grep nginx"
3. Wether the port is opened or not ? ---> "netstat -lntp"
4. Check wether the service is running or not ? ---> "systemctl status <service-name>"
5. Check wether the firewall is opened or not ?
6. Check if internet is working or not by "ping google.com (or) ping IPaddress"

How to give admin access (or) any other access to linux users ?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Example two types of users.
Linux admin team ---> Full access
DevOps team ---> Limited sudo access

1. Create two groups :- admin,devops ---> groupadd admin, groupadd devops
2. Create two users :- ramesh,suresh ---> useradd ramesh, useradd suresh
3. Create two passwords :- ramesh,suresh ---> passwd ramesh, passwd suresh
4. Make password authentication to yes ---> vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config and systemctl restart sshd
5. Add ramesh in admin team :- usermod -g admin ramesh
6. Add suresh in devops team :- usermod -g devops suresh
7. To check their details :- id suresh, id ramesh

Now how to give access ? 
-------------------------
Generally to give sudo access we have one file "/etc/sudoers" So "vim /etc/sudoers", It is not 
recommended to open this file because it crucial so linux has given one command to open file safely 
that is "visudo"
1. Ramesh ---> Add him to wheel group (or) give admin full access, under wheelgroup enter
   %admin ALL=(ALL)   ALL
2. Suresh---> Add him to wheel group give required limited access
   %devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl

This is like giving full admin access but we cannot give full access to everyone, we can give 
only few limited access like "yum" command(To know where this command is installed "which yum" (or) 
"which systemctl" command then open "visudo" under the %wheel group add this line 
"%devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl" So this way we can give limited access

Everytime opening "visudo" is also a risky, So linux has given one location ---> vim /etc/sudoers.d
# vim /etc/sudoers.d/devops(created folder) ---> %devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl
# vim /etc/sudoers.d/admin(created folder) ---> %admin ALL=(ALL)   ALL

3Tier architecture(52:33)
--------------------------
Load balancer
     |   
     *
Frontend servers :- Apache,nginx,IIS etc. Applications we deploy in frontend is 
                    HTML,JS,reactJS,AngularJS
Backend servers  :- Jboss,tomcat,weblogic etc. Applications we deploy in backend is 
                    Java,.net,python etc.
Database servers :- sql,mysql,nosql,redis etc.

Points to remember
*******************
1. Why adding in the wheel group only ? Because wheel group has admin access
2. To change password authentication to yes "vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config" make sure to restart
   "systemctl restart sshd"
