Service management (Example posting a letter from Delhi --> Hyd)
-----------------------------------------------------------------
We have 0-65,535 IP_addresses are there in computer including mobiles(Consider it is apartment),if you dont give port number it will halt at the apartment(0-65,535 IPaddresses),we have different blocks in apartment like ssh(22),http(80),https(443),msql(3006),SMTP(25),like popular protocols and ports
nginx is http protocol port no.80

Example1:-
----------
ssh -i <private-key> ec2-user@IPaddress

# first request will reach to IPaddress
# system will check user is connecting to which protocol? like anything running ssh process
  with port no.22
# then it will check the user and privatekey is correct or not (or) authentication will be
  checked by system
# if authentication is passed then we able to connect to it

Example2:-
-----------
www.facebook.com:443

# first request go to fb ipaddress
# system will check any https process is running in 443 or not
# if running login page will be showed

Algorithm
------------
1.keygenerate
2.import publickey
3.firewall
4.instance created
5.connected
  if we follow algorithm troubleshooting will be easy nothing like writing yourself in a  
  notes in general language
6.search for popular protocols in google and know about them

=============================================================================================

1.Install nginx "sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y"
2."systemctl start nginx" ---> this how running a package into a service
3."systemctl status nginx"---> to know if it is running or not (or) we can also check with
   process
4."systemctl stop nginx"---> to stop the service
5."systemctl enable nginx"--> automatically services will run
6."systemctl disable nginx"
7.nginx is used on http protocol and port no.80

Network managment
------------------
# network statistics "netstat -lntp(listing,n=portNo,p=Process,t=tcp protocol)"---> if 
  netstat is not installed then install it,this command is used to check if ports are running
  (or) not.
# to check their process also then take "sudo netstat -lntp"
# to check wether the netstat is installed or not just enter "netstat"

Trouble shooting process
--------------------------
1.check system resources like 
   CPU memory high consumption---> generally we check this in task manager,but in terminal 
   just "top"command
   hardisk full---> "df -hT"
   RAM full---> "free --help" if ram is using more and more we need to kill it and restart 
   again
2.check if the process is running or not---> ps -ef | grep nginx
3.wether the port is opened or not---> netstat -lntp
4.check wether the service is running or not "systemctl status <service-name>"
5.check wether the firewall is opened or not
6.check if internet is working or not by "ping google.com or ping IPaddress"

How to give admin access or any other access to linux user?
-------------------------------------------------------------
Example two types of users
1.Linux admin team ---> full access
2.DevOps team ---> limited sudo access

Create two groups :- admin,devops ---> groupadd admin,groupadd devops
Create two users :- ramesh,suresh ---> useradd ramesh,useradd suresh
Adding ramesh in admin :- usermod -g admin ramesh
Adding suresh in devops :- usermod -g devops suresh
To check their details :- id suresh, id ramesh

How to give access? ---> generally to give sudo access we have one file "/etc/sudoers" so "vim /etc/sudoers", it is not recommended to open this file as it crucial so linux has given one command to open file safely that is "visudo"

Ramesh ---> add him to wheel group (or) give admin full access,under wheelgroup enter 
%admin ALL=(ALL)   ALL

Suresh---> add him to wheel group give required limited access
%devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl

Then set password for ramesh to connect to server,next change the password authentication by going to "vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config",then "systemctl restart sshd".this is giving of full admin access but we cannot give full access to all we can give only few access like "yum" command(to know where this command is installed "which yum" or "systemctl" command then open "visudo"under the %wheel group = "%devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl" so this way we can give limited access

Everytime opening "visudo" is also a risky,so linux has given one location that is cut the below 4 points and paste here ---> vim /etc/sudoers.d
# %devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl
# %admin ALL=(ALL)   ALL
# vim /etc/sudoers.d/devops(created folder) --> paste it here
# vim /etc/sudoers.d/admin(created folder) ---> paste it here

3tier architecture(52:33)
---------------------------
Load balancer
     |   
     *
Frontend servers :- Apache,nginx,IIS etc. Applications we deploy in frontend is 
                    HTML,JS,reactJS,AngularJS
Backend servers  :- Jdboss,tomcat,weblogic etc. Applications we deploy in backend is 
                    Java,.net,python etc.
Database servers :- sql,mysql,nosql,redis etc.
