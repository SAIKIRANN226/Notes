Service management
----------------------
Example posting a letter delhi --> hyd
we have 0-65,535 ip address(nothing but a apartment) are there in computer including mobiles,if you dont give port number it will halt at the apartment(0-65,535 ip address)
we have different blocks like ssh(22),http(80),https(443),msql(3006),SMTP(25),like popular protocols and ports
nginx is http protocol port no.80

Algorithm
------------
1.keygenerate
2.import publickey
3.firewall
4.instance created
5.connected
if we follow algorithm troubleshooting will be easy nothing like writing yourself in a notes in general language


1.Install nginx "sudo amazon-linux-extras install nginx1 -y"
2."systemctl start nginx" ---> this how running a package into a service
3."systemctl status nginx"---> to know if it is running or not (or) we can also check with process
4."systemctl stop nginx"---> to stop the service
5."systemctl enable nginx"--> automaticall services will run
6."systemctl disable nginx"


Network managment
-----------------------
"netstat -lntp(listing,n=portNo,Process)"---> if netstat is not installed then install it,this command is used to check if ports are running or not


Trouble shooting process
---------------------------
1.check system resources like 
   CPU memory high consumption---> generally we check this in task manager,but in terminal just "top"command
   hardisk full---> "df -hT"
   RAM full---> "free --help" if ram is using more and more we need to kill it and restart again
2.check if the process is running or not---> ps -ef | grep nginx
3.wether the port is opened or not---> netstat -lntp
4.check wether the service is running or not "systemctl status <service-name>"
5.check wether the firewall is opened or not
6.check if internet is working or not by "ping google.com or ping IPaddress"


How to give admin access or any other access to linux user?
---------------------------------------------------------------
example two types of users
1.Linux admin team ---> full access
2.DevOps team ---> limited sudo access
Create two groups and users in each group
ramesh---> add him to wheel group or give admin full access,under wheelgroup enter "%admin ALL=(ALL)   ALL"
suresh---> 

"vim /etc/sudoers" ----> here we need to add groups,as this is a crusial file so we should not open in this so linux has given "visudo" it will open file safely,then set password for ramesh,next change the password authentication by going to "vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config",then "systemctl restart sshd".this is giving of full admin access but we cannot give full access to all for some we give some access like "yum" command(to know where this command is installed "which yum" or "systemctl" command then open "visudo"under the %wheel group...= "%devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl"... so this way we can give limited access

everytime opening "visudo" is also a risky,so linux has given one directory(sudoers.d) to put there.copy that line which ever you want "%devops  ALL=(ALL)  /usr/bin/yum,/usr/bin/systemctl" ---> "vim /etc/sudoers.d/folder-name" paste here
