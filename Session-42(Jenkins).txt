Installation of jenkins (CICD tool)
************************************
1. Create 1 instance using t3.small AMI, because it is heavy application and default SG with 20gb

2. Take jenkins Public_IP and connect in the superputty (Username: centos ; Password: DevOps321)

3. Go to the "jenkins.io" click on download then select centos and run the first 4 commands in the 
   server. Jenkins is developed on java, So installing java is mandatory for the jenkins master, it 
   is not mandatory to install java in the nodes or agents

4. systemctl start jenkins ; systemctl enable jenkins ; systemctl status jenkins

5. Take jenkins instance_IP and open in chrome with jenkins port number 8080
   Usage:- 173.34.65:8080/ in the chrome, If you are facing any error proceed to click on the 
   "continue to site"

6. Once you are connected to jenkins, password will be in the shown path just cat in the server 
   Note:- You need to be the root user "sudo su -" to cat the path

7. Install suggested plugins

8. Set the username and password then start using jenkins

Whatever we do in the jenkins we call it as job, nothing but it has some work to do, just create one 
sample job in the "Free-style" is nothing but everything you do it in UI this can be done easily like for example we can create terraform resources in the aws console also that is also nothing but free-style and later we started creating resources through scripting, So now create a sample freestyle job take buildsteps 
as "execute shell" apply and save then click on "buildnow' and check in the console output.

What is the difference between creating aws resources through the aws console and scripting ?
**********************************************************************************************
Advantanges that we can control the versions like if something goes wrong we can rollback the changes
to the previous version and we have PR process to understand what is happening etc. When you create a 
jobs in free-style we dont know who created ? who did the changes ? and restoring is difficult, and
maintaining is difficult because it doesn't have any versions etc. So nobody is using free-style but 
still jenkins is providing the option to create jobs using free-style. 

What is the difference between free-style job and pipeline job ?
*****************************************************************
Free-style job is no one preffering now everything you can do it from the console and it is very easy 
for everyone to do changes and we dont understand who did what changes and it is very difficult to 
restore to the normal stage because of this we moved to the pipeline.

Now understand the pipeline syntax from the google just type "jenkins pipeline" and look at the first 
link, Now create a job with pipeline select "hello-world" from the pipeline script just for sample and
build, you can add any number of stages in the hello-world script. Here if you put the pipeline in the 
jenkins, then also everybody can come and do the changes, So we have another option called
"Pipeline script from SCM". If you put this pipeline in the git then jenkins will automatically pull from 
the git and build it, we call this as "GitOps" this is the best approch

Create a project in the VS ----> Learn-Jenkins, jenkins script always start from capital letter "J"
as "Jenkinsfile" and select job as "Pipeline script from SCM" in the jenkins UI and give the created 
git URL. No need of credentials because it is public and script path as same name as created "Jenkins"

Raw syntax of a pipeline interview-question
********************************************
pipeline {
      agent {
         node {
             label 'saikiran-agent'
         }
      }
      stages {
          stage('Build') {
               steps {
                  echo 'Building...'
               }
          }
          stage('Test') {
               steps {
                  echo 'Testing...'
               }
          }
          stage('Deploy') {
               steps {
                  echo 'Deploying...'
               }
          }
      }
}

What is agent in jenkins
*************************
For example 1 person can do ----> 1 acre of agriculture 
If 100 acres ? ----> Then he will recruit employees and distribute the work,
Similarly if you are using only one project then one "Jenkins-Master" is enough, If you have multiple 
projects, one single jenkins server cannot handle the load alone, for that we have agents that is nothing
but "Master ---> Agent". Here agent is nothing but another server, so create another server in the aws 
for agent.

How do you configure the Master-Agent architecture in jenkins ?
****************************************************************
We have multiple agents we configure them through below options
Manage jenkins ---> Nodes ---> Create node in this we have one option called executors nothing but
how many jobs can be run at a time this depends on instance configuration as of now we put 3
"remote root directory" generally jenkins as created a folder in which jenkins entire database is in /var/lib/jenkins/ , Similarly while creating agent we also need to give agent path which is
/home/centos/jenkins-agent, because centos dont have sudo access in /var/lib/jenkins, it has only in the 
home folder or click on the question mark ? symbol there you can see how to give the path. Labels we can
set multiple lables as agent-1 and we have Launch methods 1. Master asking agent to work
2. Agent comming to master and asking for work. We can use any of them , as of now we are going for 
Master asking agent to work that is nothing but "Launch agents via ssh" that means master is connecting
to agent through ssh protocol then what is the host ? Do we need to give agent public_ip or private_ip ?
we can give any of them but siva took private_IP. Then configure the credentials using Username:
centos click on Treat username as secret and Password: DevOps321, ID= ssh-auth, Host key verification 
strategy ? ---> non-verifying verification startegy, that means when you are creating first it will not 
ask for prompt to yes. There must be java in the agents no need to have jenkins but java is mandatory 
in agents install using the same command which you have used in master, we can add any number of agents 
like 1 agent is for java, 1 agent is for roboshop, 1 agent is for flipkart

How many agents you are using ?
********************************
We are supporting multiple programming languages like java,python,nodesjs,.net for each language we have 
2-2 agents

Go through the Parameters in Jenkinsfile VS

Triggers
*********
We have a "WebHook" is nothing but when there is an event occurs in one system then it should inform 
to the other systems, it is called "event based communication" What is event in this scenario, when 
developer pushes the code to git then we want pipeline to run automatically, Here we have two systems
1.Git 2.Jenkins , event will come in git, So Git should have information about jenkins(URL), Go the 
WebHook option in Github in your working repository only, click on add "WebHook" add the jenkins URL 
like "http://12.233.34.53:8080/github-webhook/" ----> Payload URL , content type ---> application json,
you have multiple events we can select according to our requirements as of now we selected "Pushes"
Similarly in jenkins also we need to check then box "GitHub hook trigger for GITScm polling" and Now
try to do changes and see wether it is working or not.
