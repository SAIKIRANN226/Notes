Go through the session-01 in VS which is created EC2 with SG using variables
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Note:-And dont forget to put ".gitignore" better to put in the root folder in terraform not only in terraform root folder for example if you are creating any other new folder then you need to put there also,because when you hit "terraform init" then terraform will download the provider and this provider memory is almost 350mb.github is only to store code not software (or)exe files,so github will automatically reject,so thats why .gitignore is important here

Variables(VS)
--------------
If it is strating from the flower brases {} ---> it is a map type

Terraform.tfvars
-----------------
instance_type = "t3.small" 

# if you dont give the default value in the variables.tf,terraform will ask for the 
  prompt,so if you create a terraform.tfvars and declare value it will overwrite this tfvars
  so terraform will take this value. we can declare values in the variables.tf and we can 
  give the values in the terraform.tfvars

# generally terraform.tfvars is used to overwrite the default values in variables.tf

# we can also give from the command prompt by using the below command
  "terraform plan -var="instance_type=t3.medium"

# here terraform.tfvars name is not mandatory we can use any name like saikiran.tfvars and 
  this will become file and we can pass variable file by using below command

# terraform plan -var-file="saikiran.tfvars"

# environment variable 

Conditions(VS)
--------------
if(expression) {
	if true this will run
}
else{
	if false this will run
} 

We have one line condition also that is 
----------------------------------------
expression ? "this will run if true" : "this will run if false" ---> terraform will follow 
this only

Loops(2types)
--------------
1.count based loop --> to iterate list like creating multipe instances
2.foreach loop --> to iterate maps like creating route53 records

Functions(VS)
--------------
It will do some work,if we give some input and it will take this input and give output.
here in terraform we cannot create our own functions but terraform itself has some functions we need to use that only
Example:- max(5,12,23) --> max is the function and we are giving inputs 5,12,23 then terraform will give output that is 23, similarly we have other functions also, and we have used lenght function --> length(var.instance_names)

Locals
-------
Locals is just like variables but it has some extra capabilities,you can keep functions and expressions,conditions inside a local and use them
