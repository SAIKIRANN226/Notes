1. In linux we are automatically landing in the home directory to know that just "pwd" then 
   you will get "/c/users/user(saikiran) here definitely you will have ".ssh" folder 
2. Why this ssh authentication to the github to push the code ? Because we work with multiple github
   accounts so for every account logging with username and password is not a good practice so we prefer 
   to use ssh based authentication over username and password authentication
3. Github ---> Is nothing but a folder in internet with tracking capabilities
4. git branch -M main --> To change from master to main
5. Learn Dzone git commands

6. git add . ; git commit -m "proper message" ; git push -u origin master

"Shellscript" is also known as "Bashscript"
--------------------------------------------
1. #!/bin/bash ----> This we call it as shibang it is the first line to check the syntax of the 
   shellscript, we need to give the location of bash which is "/bin/bash" but we write as #!/bin/bash 
   apart from the first line if you see "#" anywhere it is commentout
2. If you want git in visual studio only then go to view ---> terminal ---> select gitbash
3. If you enter wrong URL while pushing then we can set 
    "git remote set-url origin <url of the repository>"
4. If git is not configured in the github account yet. Still developers can start writing their
   code in the VS untill git is ready and the they can push it to the git later.
5. A normal folder will become git when you initialise it like "git init"

01-hello-world.sh
==================
1. We develop code in vs 
2. Using gitbash client we push the code to the github repository
3. Create a server in aws
4. Pull the code in server from github, or you can clone by using https, if it is a new repo go
   for "clone", if you want only changes then "git pull"
5. Go to the path where the shell script is, then 
6. "sh <script-name>" we get the ouput
7. Echo is only used for printing purpose

02-variables.sh
================
1. Dry concept don't repeat yourself
2. We can give variables in capital letters but not mandatory,for calling a variable give "$"
3. What ever you add the changes first push it to the github then only pull from the server
   git add . ; git commit -m "message" ; git push

03-variables.sh
================
How do you run commands in shellscript and take output?
${command} ---> Usage ===> DATE=$(date)
                           echo "script started executing at ${DATE}"

04-variables.sh
================
We can give arguments outside the shell. Usage ---> "sh <script-name> ram raheem"

05-variables
=============
For example if we want to connect to any external systems like DB we need username and password, 
if we give username and password outside the shell everybody can see that. So to make confidential
we have "read command"

06-data-types.sh
=================
int,float,string etc.
In shellscript data type is not much important, it will automatically consider which data type is.
Usage in server:- "sh <script-name> 100 200"

07-arrays.sh
=============
Array index will start from 0,1,2,3.... We have notation for "ALL" that is "@" 
Usage:- "sh 07-arrays.sh"

Points to remember
-------------------
1. If you make any changes in the code in VS if you save that changes by pressing ctrl+S then colour 
   will change to yellow.So to make normal then you must push the code to the github account
