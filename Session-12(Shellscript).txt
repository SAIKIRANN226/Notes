1. In linux we are automatically landing in the home directory to know that just "pwd" then 
   you will get "/c/users/user(saikiran) here definitely you will have ".ssh" folder 
2. Why this ssh authentication to the github to push the code ? Because we work with multiple github
   accounts so for every account logging with username and password is not a good practice so we prefer 
   to use ssh based authentication over username and password authentication
3. Github ---> Is nothing but a folder in internet with tracking capabilities
4. git branch -M main --> To change from master to main
5. Learn Dzone git commands

6. git add . ; git commit -m "proper message" ; git push -u origin master

Shellscript(bash script)
-------------------------
#!/bin/bash ----> this we call it as shibang it is the first line to check the syntax of the 
 shellscript we need to give the location of bash,apart from the first line if you see # 
 anywhere it is commentout
# If you want git in visual studio only go to view ---> terminal ---> select gitbash
# If you enter wrong URL while pushing then we can set 
    "git remote set-url origin <url of the repository>"
# If git is not configured in the github account yet.even developers can start writing their
  code in the VS untill git is ready and the they can push it to the git later.
# A normal folder will become git when you initialise it like "git init"
# echo is only used for printing purpose

1.we develop code in vs 
2.using gitbash client we push the code to the github repository
3.create a server in aws
4.pull the code in server from github,or you can clone by using https,if it is a new repo go
  for"clone",you want only changes then"git pull"
5.go to the path where the shell script is,then 
6."sh <script-name>" we get the ouput

Variables(VS)
--------------
# Dry concept dont repeat yourself
# We can give variables in capital letters but not mandatory,for calling a variable give "$"
# What ever you add the changes firt push it to the github then only pull from the server
  git add . ; git commit -m "message" ; git push

How do you run commands in shellscript and take output?
--------------------------------------------------------
${command} ---> Usage => DATE=$(date)
                         echo "script started executing at ${DATE}"

Arguments,args(VS)
-------------------
We can give arguments outside the shell 
Usage ---> "sh <script-name> ram raheem"

For example we need to connect external systems like to connect to DB,we need username and password(VS-->05-variables.sh)

Data Types(VS)
---------------
int,float,string etc.
In this shell data type is not much important it will automatically consider which data type is.Usage in server:- sh <script-name> 100 200

Arrays(VS)
-----------
Array index will start from 0,1,2,3....we have notation for "ALL" that is "@" 
Usage:- sh 07-arrays.sh

Important note:- If you make any changes in the code in VS if you save that changes by pressing ctrl+S then color will change to yellow.So to make normal then you must push the code to the github account
