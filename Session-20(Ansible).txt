In this session we are configuring roboshop project with ansible
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a server and install ansible in it by "sudo yum install ansible -y",here from ansible 
   we connect to the nodes

Here siva is creating the instances and also records using already created shellscript(roboshop.sh)as 
creating through ansible is some difficult he will show in the upcomming sessions so you need to give 
role to create the instances ---> actions/security/modifyIAM/select your role which you already created
and then run the roboshop.sh script "sh roboshop.sh" to create instances

Delete the old records if exists ---> hosted zones --> except NS and SOA

Now create roboshop project
-----------------------------
1. Create folder in VS "roboshop-ansible"
2. Create repo with same name
3. Git init
4. Git remote add origin URL

Refer Roboshop-ansible in VS
