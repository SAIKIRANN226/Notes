In this session we are configuring roboshop project with ansible
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Create a server and install ansible in it by "sudo yum install ansible -y", from ansible we connect 
to the nodes and here siva is creating the instances and also records using already created shellscript(roboshop.sh) as creating through ansible is somewhat difficult he will show in the upcoming sessions. So just copy the https URL from the github of roboshop.sh and clone in the ansible server 
and go to the roboshop location and run this command "sh roboshop.sh" before this you need to give 
role to the ansible server to create the instances ---> Actions/security/modifyIAM/select your role 
which you have already created or create a new one and then run the roboshop.sh script "sh roboshop.sh" to create instances, before this delete the old records if exists ---> hosted zones --> Except NS and SOA.

Now create roboshop project
-----------------------------
1. Create folder in VS "roboshop-ansible"
2. Create repo with same name
3. Git init
4. Git remote add origin URL
5. Make sure inventory.ini has all IP addresses

Refer Roboshop-ansible in VS
-----------------------------
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321 mongodb.yaml

Preferences
------------
1. Mongodb
2. Catalogue
3. 

Points to remember
*******************
1. In ansible i have used file module,dnf module,user module,get url modules etc.
2. How to connect to mongodb from catalouge ? "mongo --host mongodb.daws76s.online" and use "exit"
3. To check wether the data is there or not in catalogue ? 
   "mongo --host mongodb.daws76s.online --quiet --eval 'db = db.getSiblingDB'("catalogue"); 
   db.products.count()'
4. Should check the above command in /app/schema folder
5. To check wether the catalogue is connected to mongodb or not ?
   sudo su - and then "tail -f /var/log/messages
