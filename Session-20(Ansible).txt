In this session we are configuring roboshop project with ansible
------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a server and install ansible in it by "sudo yum install ansible -y",here from ansible 
   we connect to the nodes

Here sivakumar is creating the instances and also records using already created shellscript(roboshop.sh)as creating through ansible is some difficult he will show in the upcomming sessions so you need to give role 
to create the instances ---> actions/security/modifyIAM/select your role which you already created

Delete the old records ---> hosted zones --> except NS and SOA

Now create roboshop project
-----------------------------
1.create folder in VS "roboshop-ansible"
2.create repo with same name
3.git init
4.git remote add origin URL

1.create inventory.ini ---> refer this code in github, giving ini extension because syntax will highlight
2.mongodb.yaml
3.mongodb.repo
4.catalouge.yaml
5.catalouge.service
