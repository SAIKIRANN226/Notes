14-without-exit-status.sh
==========================
The main disadvantage in shell scripting is we need to check every line through exit status, So to set automatically exit, we need to give "set -e" we have without exit status file in shell scripting
here "e = automatically exit"

Instead of giving &>>logfile everywhere, we can give "exec &>>logfile" under logfile name

To check the logs "sudo less /var/log/messages" we can check remote connections are successfully connected or not

unzip -o /tmp/we.zip ----> Here "o" is overwrite
