14-without-exit-status.sh
--------------------------
The main disadvantage in shell scripting is we need to check every line through exit status, So to set automatically exit, we need to give "set -e" we have without exit status file in shell scripting
here "e = automatically exit", mostly this wont work, so we dont use this method

1. Instead of giving &>>logfile everywhere, we can give "exec &>>logfile" under logfile name
2. To check the logs "sudo less /var/log/messages" we can check remote connections are successfully 
   connected or not in this logs
3. unzip -o /tmp/we.zip ----> Here "o" is overwrite

Points to remember
*******************
1. Even after changing anything if it is still not reflecting then you need to restart "systemctl restart"
2. Make sure to add all internal servers in the web cofiguration in the last step and make sure to 
   restart after changing any configuration using "systemctl restart" command
