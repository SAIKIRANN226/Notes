Continuation of the roboshop configuration through ansible
-----------------------------------------------------------
In roboshop.sh ---> There is a "UPSERT" previously it was "create" now upsert ---> Means if record 
exist it will edit, if not exist it will create and while running "roboshop.sh" file you will get 
the error "unable to locate credentials you need to configure credentials by running aws configure" 
that means you dint add the role for this ---> actions/secuirty/modifyIAM-role/add your already 
created role to the ansible-server

You can follow as per the document also but configuring by sequence is recommended
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. mongodb.yaml/mongodb.repo
2. catalogue.yaml/catalogue.service
3. web.yaml/roboshop.conf ---> In web we need to add our publicIP address in hostedzone records
4. redis.yaml
5. user.yaml
6. cart.yaml
7. mysql.yaml/mysql.repo
8. shipping.yaml
9. rabbitmq.yaml
10. payment.yaml

Command vs shell
-----------------
Shell ---> It is like you login inside server and running the command, env variables and redirections
           symbols will work
Command ---> It is like running command outside the server, env variables and redirections 
             symbols will not work,in command redirections will not work,it will work in shell

Points to remember
*******************
1. First create ansible-server and intall ansible in it
2. Run roboshop.sh script to create instances from the ansible-server only
3. Clone the "roboshop-shell" to create the instances from the roboshop.sh script
4. Run the roboshop.sh script
5. Now clone roboshop-ansible project in the ansible-server only
6. Run every module with the ansible command
7. We created functions in the shell to avoid the repetition of the code, so similarly in 
   ansible we have roles
