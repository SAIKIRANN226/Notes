Synchronous vs Asynchronous
----------------------------
http and https are ---> sync communication server should be always up and running, if servers not running 
we get error code like 400/500. that is called synchronous

Asynchronous
-------------
Servers should 100% up and always running it should not down for that we use asynchronous
Client ---> messaging broker(messaging queue) ---> Servers
Example:- Whatsapp messaging when other person is offline
