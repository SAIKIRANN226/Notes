Basic Linux commands
---------------------
ls ---> list subdirectories
cd ---> change directory
cd .. ---> one step back
/ ---> root directory
- ---> file
w ---> write
r ---> read
x ---> execute
ls -l ---> lengthy format in alphabetical order
ls -lr ---> lengthy format in reverse alphabetical order
ls --help ---> will provide all the commands regarding LS, but we dont use all
ls -lt ---> based on latest timing
ls -ltr ---> oldest timing
ls -la ---> lists all folders and files including hidden
touch ---> create the empty file
mkdir ---> creates folder
blue color is folder
white color is file

CRUD(CREATE,READ,UPDATE,DELETE)
--------------------------------
So in entire software (or) you take any technology the background is CRUD. Example:- www.facebook.com, 
login (or) signup (or) update etc. what ever you do CRUD will happen in background

Updating file with content
---------------------------
1. cat > file-name and then start entering content (one greaterthan symbol > always replaces the content)
2. cat >> file-name will appends(add) the new content
3. To save this ---> enter and ctrl+D
4. To read file ---> cat <file-name>

Remove file and folder
-----------------------
rm <file-name> ---> Deletes the file
rmdir <folder-name> ---> Deletes the empty folder
rm -r <folder-name> ---> Deletes the files also ("r" means recursive go inside and delete everything)

Copy command(cp)
-----------------
cp <source where the file is?> <destination>
cp -r ---> recursive and Usage:- "cp sample /Videos"

Move command(mv)
-----------------
With in the same folder if you use mv command, it works as a rename also. So mv command can also 
be used for renaming and Usage:- "mv sample /Videos"

grep command
-------------
grep <word-to-find> <file-name>
Linux is a case sensitive. linux will treat DevOps and DEVOPS different to make this case insensitive(i) 
use "grep -i <word-to-find> <file-name>"

Piping symbol
--------------
| ---> One command output will become the input to the another command

wget vs curl commands
----------------------
wget is nothing but "get from web"
wget ===> Used to download the file like example chrome .exe file
curl ===> Downloads the content directly on the terminal without downloading file, we use this more, for example take your any session URL from git and try make sure use only RAW URL of the session
Usage ===> curl <RAW URL of the session>

cut command
------------
# https://github.com/saikiran-notes/blob/master/session.txt
# To cut this we use "delimiter" here ":" and "/" are the delimiters, we get fragments in delimiter
Command ==> cut -d / -f1
Usage ==> "echo https://github.com/saikiran-notes/blob/master/session.txt | cut -d /f1"

awk command
------------
Command ===> awk -F / '{print $1F}' 
To get last fragment just use awk -F / '{print $NF}'
awk will divide the data based on columns so we use the above command

Head and tail commands
-----------------------
head <file-name> ==> First 10 lines
tail <file-name> ==> Last 10 lines
to get specific ==> head -n 1 <file-name>  == first line,similarly tail also

VIM(visually improved editor)
------------------------------
vim <file-name> then press "i" to enter the content or change the content
to save that ===> :wq(write and quit)
to not save ===> :q!
to quit the file ===> :q
to set numbers ===> :set nu
to unset numbers ===> :set nonu
clear last search highlight ===> :noh
You cannot go directly from "colon/command" mode to "insert" mode, you need to go to the "esc"mode first

Searching in the file in server
--------------------------------
:/<word-to-search> ---> Search from the top
:?<word-to-search> ---> Search from the bottom
in ESC mode ---> shift+G ==> go to bottom, gg ==> will take to top
"n" ---> pressing n n n ... will show what is next

We use Ctrl+F ===> to find (or) search (or) replace in windows, but to replace in linux 
":s/<word-to-find>/<word-to-replace>" replaces the word where your cursor is. This will replace only 
first occurance in the line, To replaces all use "/g", if you want any particular line then 
":2s" s=substitute
Example:- ":%s/sbin/SBIN/g" ===> %s means all occurances

Where ever your curosor is just press "yy" it will copy
Just press "p" to paste
Just press "u" to undo
Just press "10p" it will copy 10 times

Points to remember
*******************
1. curl downloads content directly on the terminal
2. grep -i <word-to-find> <file-name>
3. :/<word-to-find> ---> in the server from the top
4. :/? <word-to-find> ---> in the server from the bottom
