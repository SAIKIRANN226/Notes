Overall configuration process
------------------------------
1. Configure all instances as per the documentation 
2. Create records for all instances in the route53 and (Public_IP for only web and private_IP for 
   remaining) and dont give the sub domain for web instance
3. Dont forget to give all other information in the web 

ALL components first hit redis because it is a cache server if the data is not available in redis then it 
will hit to the DB and in the redis we can see bind 127.0.0.1 and remove # and keep "bind 0.0.0.0 ::1" 
wherever you see bind change it to 0.0.0.0

Steps to install any application in linux
------------------------------------------
1. First we should have server or instance
2. Which ever application like nodejs,.net,java,python etc. any language
3. Install that programming language
4. Create a directory for this and create separate user for that application
5. Download the application, and also install dependencies, if it is nodejs it is "npm", if it 
   java,"maven", for python"pip", for .net "nuget"after downloading how to run? for that we are
   giving it in ".service file "/etc/systemd/system/application.service"
6. Systemctl start application
7. Systemctl enable application

# npm will install dependencies and similarly mvn clean package will also install 
  dependencies and give a jar file

# If we compile java ---> We get bytecode(jarfile), remaining languages like python,nodejs no need
  to compile it will run directly
