- In last session we completely developed vpc module and started using it, in this session we are going to 
  create security group module and creating all security groups for all components.
- We created a folder "Roboshop-terraform" in |VS| and inside this folder we are creating separate folders 
  for every resources to reduce the refresh time because if our infrastructure becomes big, refreshing the 
  resources will take some time, so to reduce the refresh time we are creating in separate folders. In simple
  words like if we keep all resources in a single folder, incase if we do any small change also, it will take
  time to refresh all the resources and maintenance will also be easy.
- So go through the 01-vpc, 02-sg, 03-vpn, 04-ec2 code in |VS| one by one
- What is main input required to create a SG ? We want VPC_ID, in which vpc you are creating SG, 
  here vpc and sg are in different folders, if it was in same folder we can easily get the vpc_id, but 
  these are in different folders, For example if they are in separate folders then they are completely 
  like different projects, for example like in big companies there will be a separate team for vpc, 
  and for SG like that. How do you get vpc_id by going out from the sg folder, for that we have a service
  called "SSM Parameter" in "AWS systems manager" in this we need to create a key-value pair, and we can 
  refer in the security group to the vpc_id. SSM Parameter is like configuration storage, different 
  applications can store the configuration and also different application can refer the configuration.
  It is like central storage for the configuration.
- So first store the vpc_id in ssm parameter store, so create a file called "parameter.tf" in 01-vpc
  then write a code. Search in google "ssm parameter store in terraform"









Points to remember
*******************
- Data sources is used to query the data dynamically from the providers and for existing resource also 
  but to query the existing resource we need to give some input like vpc_id, this vpc_id we cant get 
  from the data source, but we used data source only to query the default vpc_id
