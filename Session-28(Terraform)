How to create multiple environments with terraform in 3 ways
-------------------------------------------------------------
1. Tfvars ---> Is used to overwrite the default values in variables.tf
2. Workspaces 
3. Different Repos for different Environments

1. Tfvars method
-----------------
For example we want mongodb-dev, shipping-dev, etc.
                    mongodb-prod, shipping-prod, etc.
                    mongodb-dev.daws76s.online, mongodb-prod.daws76s.online, etc.
                    shipping-dev.daws76s.online, shipping-prod.daws76s.online etc.
Same code but with different configuration, that means we need to control using variables for different 
env's by using tfvars. Different buckets to maintain states by creating different folders "dev,prod". 
what do you think ? Using different buckets for dev and prod, or same buckets ? different is the best, 
we can also use same buckets but we make sure different evn's should not get disturbed. How do we maintain different buckets ? By creating two buckets for dev and prod in "AWSconsole" and also create dynamodb 
tables for dev and prod

Controlling environments using variables
-----------------------------------------
So we have web-dev,web-prod other than that we get web-qa like that, how to control this ?
1. If key starts with web then we can write a condition using terraform inbuilt function that is
   startswith(each.key, "web")
2. When you do terraform init ---> backend will also be there, so here you have multiple environments, 
   so use "terraform init -backend-config=dev/backend.tf"
3. terraform plan -var-file=dev/dev.tfvars ---> If you dont mention the file name it will load 
   default variables
4. terraform apply -var-file=dev/dev.tfvars
5. terraform destory -var-file=dev/dev.tfvars
So when you do for the next one prod (or) other env then you need to reconfigure or when you are switching from one env to another you must reinitialize by using below command. "terraform init -reconfigure -backend-config=prod/backend.tf". [Note:- when you forget to give the -var-file then terraform will take default variables which is in variables.tf, now you comment out the default variables then terraform will prompt for the variables, so you will get know that i forgot to give varfile.

2. Workspaces method
---------------------
We can manage multiple environments using single code (or) same code, only few backends will support 
this, s3 is one of them. If you want to know workspace commands just "terraform workspace". How to create workspace ? ---> "terraform workspace new dev" --> do it in gitbash. When you are using terraform it has default variable that is "terraform.workspace", so if you are in dev then its value of "terraform.workspace become --> dev", if you are in prod then its value of "terraform.workspace --> will become prod". So you 
need to write lookup function this function works as if you pass key we can get that value. In tfvars example there are two separate buckets were created like dev/prod, but in workspaces there is only one default 
bucket "env:/" inside it will automatically create dev/prod workspaces.

3. Creating different repos for different environments
-------------------------------------------------------

Which approch is best ?
------------------------
1. Pros ---> same code
   Cons ---> same code for multiple environments, you need to be very careful because whatever changes you 
             do that will apply to all env's also
2. Pros ---> same code
   Cons ---> same code for multiple environments, you need to be very careful because whatever changes you 
             do that will apply to all env's also. Terraform is also maintaining same bucket that may cause 
             errors and difficult to maintain variables
3. Pros ---> since everything is different you no need to worry
   Cons ---> you need to maintain code duplication 2 repos, if it is big project or crucial project better 
             to maintain this method, or we can go for remaining 2 methods

Provisioners is only for ec2 instances
---------------------------------------
2 types :- 1. local-exec ---> local to where you are running terraform command(laptop) in laptop is 
           nothing but gitbash, then local is your current laptop, if you run terraform command from the 
           linux server. What will be the local here ? local will be the linux server. [Note:- local-exec 
           will run only one time, to run again you need to destroy first]
           2. remote-exec ---> This will run inside the server, first you should connect to the 
           server, then you can run anything inside the server.
Provisioners are useful to integrate terraform with configuration management tools like ansible and also enable a keyword called "self"

What is difference between terraform and ansible ?
---------------------------------------------------
Ansible ---> Is intendent for configuration management, what is the main input for the configuration 
             management ? ---> server must be created, so if you have server available wether it is 
             onpremise or in cloud, then we can use ansible to configure the server
Terraform ---> Responsibility is to create server nothing but infrastructure creation, server
               configuration is nothing but configuration management.
So server created then we handover the IPaddress to ansible, it will takecare of the provisioning or
configuration management, if you integrate terraform and ansible you will get end-end automation using provisioners. [Note:- We can also create ec2 instances using ansbile but it does not have state file as terraform does, thats why terraform is perfect for creation of infra]

Creation time and Destroy time
-------------------------------
Creation time ---> This local exec will run when server is created when we apply
Destroy time ---> At the time of destory
Why we use this creation time and destroy time ? To trigger other systems like sending emails when servers created (or) when destoryed.

Points to remember
*******************
1. Use different key names in s3 buckets like in the previous you used different key "foreach" you can use 
   as per your wish but not with the same key names because it will merge all.
2. If you are facing any error in pushing the code to the github use the below command
    "git remote set-url origin <URL>"
3. If the code in VS is in full green colour that means the repository is not yet ready in the github, 
   when repo is ready then it will turn to normal colour after pushing to git
4. We can write multiple provisioners also like for example "on_failure = continue" nothing but same as
   ignore errors in ansible.
