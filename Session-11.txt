Project configuration
------------------------
1.create server
2.install programming language
3.download code / application
4.create directories and users
5.install dependencies
6.start application


Deployment/release
---------------------
1.developer push the code
2.stop the server
3.remove/backup the old code
4.download new code
5.start the server


The above is manual then what is the diff btw manual and automation
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Manual:-
1.downtime
2.time consuming
3.mistakes 
4.troubling shooting is tough like finding who did the mistakes,repeated tasks


Programming ---> java,.net,python
Scripting ---> shell,python,ansible,terraform,kubernetes,docker


Variables
Data types
Conditions
Functions
Loops


Algorithm thinking should be there in scripting example(installing git through scripting)
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.check user have sudo access or not
2.if not sudo through error
3.if sudo proceed
4.install package git
5.we need to check explicitly wether installed or not 
6.if error installation through the error otherwise say success


Shell scripting
------------------
where to keep scripts?git

To connect to git we use keypair publickey = inserver(centralGit), privatekey with you
1.cat publickey and paste in github ---> settings ---> ssh and gpgkeys ---> new ssh key paste there,
2.keep you private key ---> there is .ssh folder if there is no folder create one ---> in this create a file with no extension and then paste the below content

Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  PreferredAuthentication publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/daws-76s          --------> private key location (~ ---> home folder)give the location properly


Git init ---> initiaziles
git add
git commit -m "message"
git remote add origin 
git push origin master

Dont forget to configure your username and email by "git config --global"


everything is set , developing in gitbash is not so good so we have IDE(integrated development environment)

1.we have vs in laptop and develop code in vs
2.push to GIT
3.pull in the server





In git if it is https: URL you need to give username and password
If ssh then just privat key
