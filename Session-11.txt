Project configuration
----------------------
1. Creating the server
2. Installing programming languages
3. Downloading code / application
4. Creating directories and users
5. Installing dependencies
6. Start application

Deployment / Release process
-----------------------------
1. Developer push the code
2. Stop the server
3. Remove/backup the old code
4. Download new code
5. Start the server

The above is for manual process 
--------------------------------
Then what is the difference between manual and automation process ?
Manual disadvantages:-
1. Downtime
2. Time consuming
3. Human erros 
4. Trouble shooting is tough like finding who did the mistakes, and repeated tasks

Programming ---> java,.net,python etc.
Scripting ---> shell,python,ansible,terraform,kubernetes,docker

Patterns and methods to learn any scripting
--------------------------------------------
Variables
Data types
Conditions
Functions
Loops

Algorithm thinking should be there in scripting
------------------------------------------------
Example:- Installing git through scripting
1. Check user have sudo access or not
2. If not sudo throw the error
3. If sudo proceed and then
4. Install package "git"
5. We need to check explicitly wether installed or not 
6. If error in installation then throw the error, otherwise say success

Shell scripting
----------------
# Where to keep scripts? in github account
# Generate a key-pair in gitbash
# To connect to git we use keypair. publickey = should be in the server(centralGit), 
  privatekey with you
# cat publickey and paste in github ---> settings ---> ssh and gpgkeys ---> new ssh-key paste 
  there
# keep your private key ---> there is .ssh folder if there is no folder create one in 
  c/users/saikiran(user) ---> in this create a file with name of "config" with no extension 
  and then paste the below content(or)you can search in google -->git ssh config syntax

Host github.com
  HostName github.com
  User git
  PreferredAuthentication publickey
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/daws-76s -----------------> Private key location it can be anywhere it 
                                                  is not mandatory to be in the 
                                                  ~homefolder(~ ---> home folder)but need to
                                                  to give the location correctly

When you create a new repo in github
-------------------------------------
To clone any repo we have "https and SSH"
https --> you should give username and password(used by others to clone)
SSH --> just private-key is enough,now we are using this(used by owners who created repo)

Few GIT(global information tracking system) commands commonly used
--------------------------------------------------------------------
It is a de-centralised(distributed)version control system,now a days everyone is using distributed because we can recover the data if lost.but not with centralised one which are 
like TFS.
# git init
# git add
# git commit -m "message"
# git remote add origin 
# git push origin master
# Dont forget to configure your username and email by "git config --global"
# We also have staging area in the git nothing but temperory area,send the code what is completed fornow(nothing git add command only)

Now everything is set,developing in gitbash is not so good so we have IDE(integrated development environment)

1.We have VS(IDE) in laptop and develop code in vs
2.Push to GIT
3.Pull in the server
4.What ever a small change you want you must do in the VS-->push to git-->then pull in server
5.Dont do any changes in the servers
