03.multi-play.yaml
-------------------
Here giving "-" in the ansible playbook means it is list of plays(or)yaml always start with "-"

For example create 2 servers
-----------------------------
1. Ansible server make sure to install ansible in the server by "sudo yum install ansible -y" 
   then it becomes ansible server
2. Create Node server
3. Then push the changes to github and clone (or) pull in the server and execute by following command 
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321
   <playbook-name>

Variables concept
------------------
Dry concept,that means dont repeat yourself,variables we keep a aside from the code so that code will not get disturb when we are doing changes,variables holds a value you can use it anywhere.So to call a variable in ansible we use two flower brases {{ }} ,we can use this variables in play level and can be used anywhere in the task level

04.variables.yaml 
05.variables-task.yaml
06.variables-from-files.yaml
07.variables-from promt.yaml
08.vars_frominventory.yaml
09.vars_fromArgs.yaml
10.var.preference.yaml So we have these many variables right ? So which one will be preferred 
   first and then followed by other ?
11.datatypes.yaml
12.conditions.yaml
13.loops.yaml
14.loops.yaml
15.loops.yaml
16.tags.yaml
