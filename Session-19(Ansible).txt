# 03.multi-play.yaml ---> refer this in VS
# Here giving "-" in the ansible playbook means it is list of plays(or)yaml always start 
  with "-"

Create 2 servers
-----------------
For example:-
1.Ansible server make sure to install ansible in the server by "sudo yum install ansible -y" 
  then it becomes ansible server
2.Node server ---> watch the 03.multi-play.yaml in VS
3.Then gitbash,pull in server and execute by following command 
  ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=DevOps321
  <playbook-name>

Variables
----------
Dry concept,that means dont repeat yourself,variables we keep a aside from the code so that code will not get disturb when we are doing changes,variables holds a value you can use it anywhere.So to call a variable in ansible we use {{ }} , we use two flower brases,we used this variables in play level and can be used annywhere in the task level

# 04.variables.yaml ---> refer this file in VS, variables from play level
# 05.variables-task.yaml ---> variables from task level.refer this is VS
# 06.variables-from-files.yaml ---> keeping completely out of the program creating one file 
  for that is "variables.yaml"
# 07.variables-from promt.yaml
# 08.vars_frominventory.yaml
# 09.vars_fromArgs.yaml
# 10.var.preference.yamlSo we have these many variables right?So which one will be preferred 
  first and then followed by other? 10.var.preference.yaml
# 11.datatypes.yaml(- ---> list,if not - ---> then map)
# 12.conditions.yaml
# 13.loops.yaml
# 14.loops.yaml ---> install multiple packages
# 15.loops.yaml ---> install and uninstall packages
# 16.tags.yaml
