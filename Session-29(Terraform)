Modules development
--------------------
1. Dry concept, dont repeat yourself.
2. For example we created infrastructure for a project, nothing but we wrote a terraform code for this 
   infra right ? If we got another new project, do we write the terraform code from the scratch ? no we 
   dont write the code from the scratch we reuse the code, so no need to write the infra for every 
   project from the scratch, go through the code of "Terraform-Modules" in the VS.
3. Module syntax is below
      module "name" {
	source = "../ec2" ---> Actually it is one step back
      }
4. Provider will not be there in module developing.

Two types of modules and Two types of roles
--------------------------------------------
1. Customized modules for our organisation, this will create by central team in cloud.
2. Open source modules. "Module Developer" --> Who develops the module and "Module User" --> Who 
   consumes the module. [Note:- Put one README.md file to provide the documentation on the module how 
   to use it by others]

VPC(Virtual Private Cloud)
---------------------------
Watch from ---> (26:09 to 1:14:13)

Difference between Public_subnet and Private_subnet ?
------------------------------------------------------
Subnets who have access(route) to the internet gateway are public_subnets, subnets who dont have 
access(route) to the internet gateway are private_subnets or Which are attached to internet gateway 
are called public_subnets, which are not attached to the internet gateway are called private_subnets, 
here Internetgateway is nothing but arch in village example.

Create Roboshop Network(VPC)
-----------------------------
Create VPC network for Roboshop Project ---> You need to give CIDR while creating VPC, nothing but like 
pin code of a village, here siva has given 10.0.0.0/16, so this IP is public or private ? so internet
has given some "private ip_address range" you can search in google there you find three ranges and those 
only allocated to private_ip not for public_ip, there you can see 24,20,16 bit-blocks, these are only for private_ip not for public_ip, even ISP people will configure your private_ip address in any range among these three bit-blocks, as of now you can select any one for your VPC, so from this siva selected starting from 10. Atleast you need to create 16 servers to use VPC, 10.0.0.0/28 ---> 16 servers, 10.0.0.0/16 ---> 65k servers, generally we give 10.0.0.0/16 only, because it does not cost anything, so we can go for maximum.

Create Roboshop Public_subnet and Private_subnet
-------------------------------------------------
Here in "IPV4 subnet CIDR block" section you can give 10.0.1.0/24 ---> Public
Here in "IPV4 subnet CIDR block" section you can give 10.0.2.0/24 ---> Private

Create Public and Private route_tables
---------------------------------------
Make sure you select your created VPC not default for all the above subnets and tables

Create Internet gateway(Just like Modem)
-----------------------------------------
Make sure attach this Internet gateway to your VPC, you can see the option on top as soon as you created.

Now associate route_tables to the respective subnets
-----------------------------------------------------
Click on the created public_subnet ---> select Route table ---> edit route table association ---> then associate with public route_table which you have already created and do same for the private_subnet also. Select public route_table which you have created, then click on Routes --> edit routes ---> add route ---> In destination section give internet notation (0.0.0.0/0) ---> and Internet gateway in the Target section and select default from the drop down under the internet gateway only ---> then save changes. That means public_IP got the internet access and we dint given internet access to private that is the difference.

Enable auto-asign public Ipv4 address
--------------------------------------
This must be enable to only public_subnet, not for the private_subnet because it is not required, you can do this by Click on the public_subnet ---> actions ---> edit subnet settings, just check the box. [Note:- We need to create web server in the public_subnet and remaining severs like cart,shipping etc. can be created in the private_subnets]

Create a subnet for database
-----------------------------
10.0.3.0/24 and create database route table and attach it to the database subnet.

So what ever we have created all these by manually in the aws, we should create this by using terraform and minimum you need to create resources in two availability zones so that you can save from yourself from the natural disasters, that means you need to keep public and private subnets aswel as remaining subnets in two availability zones, if the company is having budget then we can create servers in both zones(or)create one and transfer(move or create in another zone in case of any natural disasters alert)

Points to remember
*******************
1. Terraform best practices like naming the resources in the terraform search in google
2. We used open source modules sometimes and we have dedicated cloud team who develops module 
   and we use them.
3. How do you check internet is working or not ? "ping google.com"
4. Ipv4 is 32bit and Ipv6 is 64 bit 
5. To know the system IP address "ipconfig" in cmd, here you can see ipv4 address, can anybody connect to 
   my laptop using this ? and there is also another IP in last that is Private_IP address of modem, modem 
   as publicIP and another privateIP (or) "Modem ===> Public_IP ---> What is my IP ; Private_IP ---> last 
   IPaddress in ipconfig"
6. What is your actual IPaddress ? Just type in google "what is my IP", if you want to connect to my 
   laptop you can connect using this IP address.
7. Your created VPC is Isolated even aws dont have access to it
8. AWS wont charge for VPC's,subnets,route tables, it only charges when you are creating server.
