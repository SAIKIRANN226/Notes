Disk usage
-----------
Command is "df -hT" if the disk usage goes above 70% we need to triggger a mail
Create another disk for practice because in real time there will be more disks go to 
Elastic Block Store ---> Volumes ---> Create volume ---> Attach to the instance
So while creating disk there is one condition like for example disk should always near to the laptop
Similarly here also disk should create in the same availability zone which server is created
