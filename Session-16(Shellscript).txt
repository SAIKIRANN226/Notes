For any programming languages (or) for any scripting. It is all about variables/datatypes/conditions/loops/functions but with different syntax, only we need to make sure with correct algorithm 

Deleting old log files
-----------------------
1. Deleting old log files, Check disk usage, Send email alerts

2. For example we have a folder, where we are storing log files

3. Delete log files more than 14 days, only with ".log" extensions not any other files

Algorithm for deleting old log files (or) simple script
--------------------------------------------------------
1. First decide what is Source-Directory (or) Folder where we are storing log files

2. Search more than 14 days old only with ".log" files not any other files

3. Delete "rm -rf"

15-delete-old-log.sh
---------------------
1. Create a folder for logs "mkdir /tmp/shellscript-logs"
2. Create few files with old date so that we can delete the old log files 
3. Command to create files with old date "touch -d 20231201 <anyname.log>" year/month/date
4. find . -type f -mtime +14 ---> f=only files, . means current directory
5. find . -type f -mtime +14 -name "*.log" ---> we want all with .log extension files
6. How to delete these files ? we use while loop to read command output

16-ifs.sh
----------
Generally we have "cat /etc/passwd" in this we have all the user information like user_id,group_id,user_name and many more other information, So how to read this whole information properly, we user IFS(Internal field separator)

17-disk-usage.sh
-----------------
Command is "df -hT" if the disk usage goes above 70% we need to triggger a mail,So create another disk 
of 12gb for practice because in real time there will be more disks so go to aws console and then navigate 
to Elastic Block Store ---> Volumes ---> Create volume ---> Action ---> Attach to the instance
So while creating disk there is one condition like for example disk should always near to the laptop.
Similarly here also disk should create in the same availability zone which server is created, when you 
check in the server "df -hT" still created disk is not showing, so you need to explicitly mount it, we 
have a command "lsblk" and to make usage create a file system using "sudo file -s /dev/xvdf" ---> dev means devices that means we are creating xvdf folder inside the devices folder, then check wether it is created 
or not "sudo lsblk -f" and then run this command "sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf" and then create a folder 
in root folder "sudo mkdir /data" then mount it "sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data" 

1. df -hT | grep xfs
2. df -hT | grep tmp
3. df -hT | grep -v tmp ---> -v means i dont want tmp files; | ---> or ; & ---> and

Commands to run in the server to mount the disk
------------------------------------------------
1. lsblk ----> To make available
2. sudo file -s /dev/xvdf ----> To create a file system
3. sudo lsblk -f ----> To check wether the disk is functional or not
4. sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf ----> It is xfs type
5. sudo mkdir /data ----> To create a data folder
6. sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data ----> Mounting

mail.sh
--------
Mailing the above disk usage
