For any programming or any scripting 
-------------------------------------
It is all about variables/datatypes/conditions/loops/functions but with different syntax only we
need to make sure with correct algorithm 

Deleting old log files
-----------------------
1. Deleting old log files and check disk usage and sending alerts

2. We have folder where we are storing log files /tmp/shellscript-logs

3. Delete log files more than 14 days, only .log extensions not any other files

Algorithm for deleting old log files (or) simple script
--------------------------------------------------------
1. First decide what is Source-Directory or Folder where we are storing log files

2. Search more than 14 days old .log files

3. Delete rm -rf

Disk usage
-----------
Command is "df -hT" if the disk usage goes above 70% we need to triggger a mail
Create another disk for practice because in real time there will be more disks go to 
Elastic Block Store ---> Volumes ---> Create volume ---> Attach to the instance
So while creating disk there is one condition like for example disk should always near to the laptop
Similarly here also disk should create in the same availability zone which server is created,when you 
check in the server disk not showing, so you need to explicitly mount it we have a command "lsblk"
and create a file system using "sudo file -s /dev/xvdf" ---> dev means devices then check wether it is 
created or not "sudo lsblk -f" and then create a folder /data in the root and mount it 
"sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data" 

Commands to run in the server to mount the disk
------------------------------------------------
1. lsblk
2. sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
3. sudo lsblk -f 
4. sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
5. sudo mkdir /data
6. sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
