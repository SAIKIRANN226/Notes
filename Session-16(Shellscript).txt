For any programming languages (or) for any scripting. It is all variables/datatypes/conditions/loops
and functions but with a little different syntax, Only we need to make sure with correct algorithm 

Deleting old log files more than 14 days old
---------------------------------------------
1. Delete old log files, Check disk usage and Send email alerts
2. For example we have a folder, Where we are storing log files
3. Delete log files more than 14 days, Only with ".log" extensions not any other files

Algorithm for deleting old log files (or) simple script
--------------------------------------------------------
1. First decide what is your Source-Directory (or) Folder where we are storing log files
2. Search more than 14 days old only with ".log" files not any other files
3. Then Delete "rm -rf" , Below is the simple script to delete old log files

15-delete-old-log.sh
---------------------
1. Create a folder for logs "mkdir /tmp/shellscript-logs" in cd location in server
2. Create few files with old date in the folder, So that we can delete the old log files 
3. Command to create files with old date "touch -d 20231201 <anyname.log>" year/month/date
4. find . -type f -mtime +14 ---> f ---> Only files, . means current directory
5. find . -type f -mtime +14 -name "*.log" ---> We want all with .log extension files only
6. How to delete these files ? We can also use "rm -rf" but we use while loop to read command 
   output line by line 
   
16-ifs.sh
----------
Generally we have "cat /etc/passwd" in this we have all the users information like user_id,group_id,
user_name and many more other information, So how to read this whole information properly, We use 
IFS(Internal field separator)

17-disk-usage.sh
-----------------
Command is "df -hT" if the disk usage goes above 70% we need to triggger a mail, So create another disk 
of 12gb for practice because in real time there will be more disks so go to aws console and then navigate 
to Elastic Block Store ---> Volumes ---> Create volume ---> Action ---> Attach to the instance
So while creating disk there is one condition like for example disk should always near to the laptop.
Similarly here also disk should create in the same availability zone which server is created, When you 
check in the server "df -hT" still created disk is not showing, So you need to explicitly mount it, We 
have a command "lsblk" and to make into usage create a file system using "sudo file -s /dev/xvdf" ---> dev means devices that means we are creating xvdf folder inside the devices folder, Then check wether it is created or not "sudo lsblk -f" and then run this command "sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf" and then create a 
folder in root folder "sudo mkdir /data" then mount it "sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data" 

Finding different types of disks using grep command
----------------------------------------------------
1. df -hT | grep xfs
2. df -hT | grep tmp
3. df -hT | grep -v tmp ---> -v means i dont want lines with tmp words; | ---> or ; & ---> and
4. df -hT | grep -vE 'tmp|File'

Commands to run in the server to mount the disk
------------------------------------------------
1. lsblk ----> To make available (or) disk is added
2. sudo file -s /dev/xvdf ----> To create a file system
3. sudo lsblk -f ----> To check wether the disk is functional (or) not ?
4. sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf ----> It is xfs type
5. sudo mkdir /data ----> To create a data folder
6. sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data ----> Mounting

mail.sh
--------
1. Mailing the above disk usage to send alerts, sending mails from linux we have to configure email
   install the packages from gmail.MD document in concepts folder in linux in home folder CD, in this 
   Postfix will hit gmail API ; cyrus-sasl-plain will set authentication ; mailx is a command to 
   send mail, so thats why we need to install these packages from gmail.MD; shift+G ---> go down in 
   the config file and add the given small config and save :wq!
2. We need from address and to address
3. So open gmail in chrome go to profile/manage your google account/security/2-step verification/
   turnon/app passwords/app-name(any)/copy the generated password this password is only for linux 
   wont work for gmail 
4. Remove spaces in password and put in the place of xyz: your gmail without "@gmail" and put in the
   vim /etc/postfix/sasl_passwd
5. We can do mail formatting for better format with color coding
6. Converting text to html format from google websites
7. Just write what ever you want from the compose mesg with required colors and copy that paste in 
   the Converting text to html format from google websites and put it in a template, we need to 
   call mail.sh

Improved way of deleting old log files
---------------------------------------
1. Instead of deleting only one particular folder user has to enter source directory
2. Action ---> We will ask user wether we should archive or delete instead of deleting log files of 
   14 days which is not good 
3. If he select archive ---> Where is the destination directory ?
4. Time ---> Optional, if he gives take it otherwise 14 days default
5. Memory ---> Optional if he dint given then dont consider memory, if he gives then consider it

Below is the usage of command
------------------------------
old-logs.sh -s <source_dir> -a <archive/delete> -d <destination_dir> -t <no-of-days> -m <memory-in-mb>

Algorithm to check for the above command
-----------------------------------------
1. Wether the user has given proper command like -s, -a, -t, -m check all these inputs, if he dont give
   proper then tell him the correct usage
2. Source directory exists or not 
3. Destination directory exists or not
4. If he dont give destination directory through the error 
5. Then archive or delete
