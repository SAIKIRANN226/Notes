DNS(Domain name system)
---------------------------
Domain registars
-----------------
godaddy,hostinger(cheap),aws etc..we are using aws clound for records because it is friendly

Next go to route53 we can also buy domain here it very costly so we buy domain in hostinger and we create records for that in aws,so go to route53 ---> Dashboard ---> Hosted zone ---> register your domain ---> create hosted zone ---> saikiran.online like whatever ---> change nameservers in hostinger(DNS record ---> 

Now create record
------------------
paste public IP in value
ttl = 1 

To check whether the record is created or not "nslookup mongodb.joindevops.online"
To check logs "tail -f /var/log/messages" you will get running logs
To check all logs "less -f /vat/log/messages"

shift+g = go down
