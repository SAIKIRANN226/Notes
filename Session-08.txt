DNS(Domain name system)
------------------------
For example when you hit "joindevops.online" where will first request will go ?
Browser ---> cache ---> OS ---> cache ---> ISP ---> cache ---> Root servers ---> TLD ---> NS ---> A record

Domain registars
-----------------
godaddy,hostinger(cheap),aws etc. we are using aws cloud for records because it is friendly
Next go to route53 we can also buy domain from aws also but it very costly so we buy domain in hostinger 
and we create records in aws, so go to route53 Dashboard ---> Hosted zone ---> Create hosted zone ---> After creating hosted zones you will get few name servers update this name servers in hostinger
"A" record will match the IPaddress

Now create record in aws
-------------------------
Paste public IP in value
ttl = 1 ---> It is like chache
To check whether the record is created or not "nslookup mongodb.joindevops.online"
To check logs "tail -f /var/log/messages" you will get running logs
To check all logs "less -f /var/log/messages"

shift+g = go down
gg = go up
q = quit
