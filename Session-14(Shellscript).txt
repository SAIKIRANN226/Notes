13-install-packages.sh
=======================
Installing any number of packages using "loops" instead of going to the script and again writing few 
commands, we can install packages from the command line itself same like giving arguments outside the 
script. And we keep these arguments in the "for loop" as shown in the script
Usage:- "sh 13-install-packages.sh git mysql postfix etc."

Algorithm to install packages
------------------------------
1. Check root user or not
2. If root user then check package is installed or not, To know if package is installed or not in the 
   server just "yum list installed", to know anything particular then "yum list installed git", to check 
   exit status of the previous command just "echo $?" if "0" it is installed, if installed skip it and 
   tell user, it is already installed, if not install it and validate
3. if not root user then throw the error

SED editor(stream line editor)it is temporary editor it will not save
----------------------------------------------------------------------
To change the configuration for humans we have VIM editor but for scripts we have SED editor
Example:- sed -e '1 a I am  learning DevOps'<file-name> ------> e=enable, a=append(after) if you want 
before first line then "i", 1=line1. if want after 2nd line then "2 a". If you want permanent change 
then keep "i" in place of "e"

Lines update
-------------
sed -e 's/<word-to-find>/word-to-replace/' ---> First occurrence in the line
sed -e 's/<word-to-find>/word-to-replace/g' ----> Global for everything

Points to remember
-------------------
1. How to check logs? ---> sudo less /var/log/messages
2. To check the ports "netstat -lntp"
3. Shellscript is nothing but put all the Linux commands in one file
