Algorithm for Catalogue CI(continous integration)
**************************************************
1. Create EC2 for Jenkins-Master and connect to it
2. Create EC2 for Agent and connect to it and install nodejs from the catalogue documentation
3. Create EC2 for Nexus and connect to it and download nexus by using "labauto" command
4. Configure Jenkins-Agent and install plugins like AnsiColor,StageView,Pipeline Utility steps,
   Nexus artifact uploader
5. Create repo in nexus for catalogue to store our artifacts
6. To push artifacts from jenkins to the nexus we need to download plugin called 
   "Nexus artifact uploader" so for that we need to give the nexusURL and authentication, 
   make sure to add nexus credentials in the manage jenkins
7. This is CI part of catalogue

General Deployment of any application
**************************************
1. Create the server
2. Provision the server using ansible or any other scripting language
3. Stop the server
4. Take AMI
5. Create Launch template version
6. Refresh auto-scaling

Previously ansible was downloading from the s3 bucket and version we are giving hardcode, Now ansible should
download from the nexus and specific version so what should we give to the ansible ?
1. Nexus location
2. Artifact version 
3. From terraform you should send artifact version to ansible









Industries will follow Semantic version like major version, minor version, patch version
Creating artifacts is nothing but CI
