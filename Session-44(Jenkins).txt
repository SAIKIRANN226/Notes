Algorithm for Catalogue CI(continous integration)
**************************************************
1. Create EC2 for Jenkins-Master and connect to it
2. Create EC2 for Agent and connect to it and install nodejs in it
3. Create EC2 for Nexus and connect to it and download nexus through "labauto"
4. Configure Jenkins-Agent and install plugins like AnsiColor,StageView,Pipeline Utility steps,
   Nexus artifact uploader
5. Create repo in nexus for catalogue to store our artifacts
6. To push artifacts to from jenkins to the nexus we need to download plugin called 
   "Nexus artifact uploader" so for that we need to give the nexusURL and authentication, make sure 
   to add nexus credentials in the manage jenkins
7. This is CI part of catalogue









Industries will follow Semantic version like major version, minor version, patch version
Creating artifacts is nothing but CI
