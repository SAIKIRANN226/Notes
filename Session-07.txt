1.Web/frontend tier        ----> stateless(if crashes,we can recover)
2.App/Api/backend tier     ----> stateless(if crashes,we can recover)
3.DB tier                  ----> statefull(if crashes,tough to recover)

CRUD over database
-------------------
When you create a new user example in facebook
1.create a user
2.read user
3.update user
4.delete user

Nginx is used as "reverse proxy" in this project,we have RHEL=Fedora=centos=awslinux all are same flavoured but in this project siva has created his own AMI based on "centos8" that is browse more AMI's in Nvirgnia ----> search "devops-practice" ---> community AMI's ---> select "Centos-8-DevOps-Practice" this is not key based because we cannot create more keys for more servers it is very tough so this is username and password authentication. username is = centos; Password is = DevOps321

1.Create security group for allowing all firewalls
2.Create a web instance with devops-pratice,no keypair
3.now create putty session ---> given session name ---> connection data --> username = 
  centos ---> appearence ---> save the session
4.open super putty and connect the web with public iP
5.now open documentation and follow the steps

# yum,dnf ---> used to install packages

Forward proxy vs Reverse proxy
-------------------------------
Forward proxy is servers are not aware of clients behind VPN,like anonymous access to hide our identity,forward proxies cant understand real clients
security ---> companies can impose restrictions not to use particular sites,and to monitor internet behaviour
clients are aware of proxy,servers are not aware(example:- vpn's)

Reverse proxy
--------------
Clients are not aware of server side(example:- nginx --> loadbalancer)
Applications use reverse proxy to secure their code

Famous HTTP status
-------------------
200 ---> success
300 ---> redirect
400 ---> client side errors(purely client side error)
500 ---> server side errors(purely prject side error)

Caching(50:01)
---------------

Username is = centos; Password is = DevOps321
