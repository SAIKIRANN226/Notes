Roboshop configure
-------------------
1. Web/frontend tier        ---->  Stateless(if crashes,we can recover)
2. App/Api/backend tier     ---->  Stateless(if crashes,we can recover)
3. DB tier                  ---->  Statefull(if crashes,tough to recover)

"CRUD" over database(example when you create a new user in facebook)
---------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Create a user if iam new to FB
2. Read user if i login 
3. Update user if i update anything in the FB
4. Delete user if i delete anything in the FB

Nginx(80) is used as "reverse proxy" in this project, we have RHEL=Fedora=centos=awslinux all are same flavoured but in this project siva has created his own AMI based on "centos8" browse more AMI's in 
Nvirgnia ----> search "devops-practice" ---> community AMI's ---> select "Centos-8-DevOps-Practice" this 
is not key based because we cannot create keys for every servers it is very tough so we are using username 
and password authentication. Username is = centos; Password is = DevOps321

1. Create security group for allowing all firewalls
2. Create a web instance with devops-pratice with no keypair to start configuring roboshop project
3. Now create putty session ---> given session name ---> connection data ---> username = centos ---> 
   appearence ---> change the font to 14 and save the session ---> click on centos and load
4. Open super putty and connect to the web instance with public iP
5. Now open documentation and follow the steps of web server configuration
6. Superputty we can create multiple tabs and we can also rename the instance
7. We are using nginx(80) as webserver like http server or webserver are same, make sure nginx should
   take http not https where you are testing the URL of nginx server
8. yum,dnf ---> Used to install packages but dnf is preffered in manual configuration because dnf consume
   very less memory
9. In the server where does the nginx configuration is saved ? "cd /etc/nginx/" vim nginx.conf
10. Where does the default content will be saved in the nginx server ? "cd usr/share/nginx/html/" in 
    this folder we have index.html file, Here we need to delete this default content and put our 
    own content

Forward proxy
--------------
Forward proxy is servers are not aware of clients behind VPN, like anonymous access to hide our identity,
forward proxies cant understand real clients. Security ---> Companies can impose restrictions not to use particular sites, and to monitor internet behaviour, Here clients are aware of proxy, servers are not aware(Example:- vpn's)

Reverse proxy
--------------
Clients are not aware of server side(Example:- nginx ---> Loadbalancer)
Applications use reverse proxy to secure their code like example nginx uses reverse proxy

Famous HTTP status
-------------------
200 ---> Success
300 ---> Redirect
400 ---> Client side errors(purely client side error)
500 ---> Server side errors(purely prject side error)

Caching(50:01)
---------------

# Now create Mongodb(t3.medium) instance and configure it  
# Then create Catalogue instance and configure it 
# How to check the running logs ? "tail -f /var/log/messages"
# Where is the reverse proxy configuration ? "vim /etc/nginx/default.d/roboshop.conf"
# Whenever you do any changes makesure "systemctl restart nginx"
