when you create a new user
1.create a user

3.update user
4.delete user

Nginx is used as reverse proxy in this project,we have RHEL=Fedora=centos=awslinux all are same flavoured but in this project siva has created his own AMI based on "centos8" that is browse more AMI's in Nvirgnia ----> search "devops-practice" ---> community AMI's ---> select "Centos-8-DevOps-Practice" this is not key based because we cannot create more keys for more servers it is very tough so this is username and password authentication. username is = centos; Password is = DevOps321



1.Create security group for allowing all firewalls
2.Create a web instance with devops-pratice,no keypair
3.now create putty session ---> given session name ---> connection data --> username = centos ---> appearence ---> save the session
4.open super putty and connect the web with public iP
5.now open documentation and follow the steps



yum is used to install packages
dnf is also same 


Forward proxy vs Reverse proxy
----------------------------------
Forward proxy is servers are not aware of clients behind VPN,like anonymous access to hide our identity,forward proxies cant understand real clients
security ---> companies can impose restrictions not to use particular sites,and to monitor internet behaviour
clients are aware of proxy,servers are not aware

Reverse proxy
--------------
clients are not aware of server side(example facebook,or nginx)
apps use reverse proxy to secure their code

Famous HTTP status
