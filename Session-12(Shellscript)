1. In linux when you open gitbash we are automatically landing in the home directory to know that 
   just type "pwd" then you can see your landed location "/c/users/user(saikiran), Here definitely 
   you will have ".ssh" folder, If it is not there you need to create .ssh folder, It will be hidden 
   so to check this enter the following command "ls -la"
2. Why we use "ssh authentication" to connect github account to push the code ? Because we work with
   multiple github accounts so for every account logging with username and password is not a good 
   practice so we prefer to use "ssh based authentication".
   a) Generate a new key-pair (or) use existing key-pair, "ssh-keygen -f <file-name>" press enter
      two times, Public-key will be with .pub extension, You need to give .pem extension manually
      for Private-key, To enable extension go to "file explorer options" in control panel/view/unhide 
      extensions for known file types
   b) Cat Public-key, copy the code and go to the github settings /SSH and GPG Keys/New SSH key/
      give any name and paste without any gaps
   c) Keep your Private-key in ".ssh" folder if it is not created you have to create it in user 
      directory like "C:\Users\saikiran\.ssh"
   d) Create a config file with no extension in .ssh folder, in this config file keep the config 
      syntax and give the correct location of your Private-key and also we can add multiple 
      github accounts. Below is the config syntax i have given for my created Private-key 
                Host github.com
                  HostName github.com
                  User git
                  PreferredAuthentications publickey
                  IdentityFile ~/saikiran.pem
   e) We have HTTPS and SSH to the repository, we use ssh authentication for pushing to the github
      HTTPS ---> Username and Password, clone https URL when you have read only access
      SSH ---> Just Private-key, you can clone if you are the owner of the respository
      Prefer HTTPS while cloning the repository
3. Github is nothing but a folder in internet with tracking capabilities
4. git branch -M main ---> To change from master to main (or) main to master
5. Learn Dzone git commands from the below URL's
   https://dzone.com/articles/top-20-git-commands-with-examples
   https://dzone.com/articles/top-35-git-commands-with-examples-and-bonus
6. git add . ; git commit -m "proper message" ; git push -u origin master

Shellscript is also known as Bashscript
----------------------------------------
1. #!/bin/bash ----> This we call it as "shibang" it is the first line to check the syntax 
   of the shellscript, we need to give the location of bash which is in "/bin/bash" but we write
   first line as "#!/bin/bash" apart from the first line, If you see "#" anywhere it is commentout
2. If you want git in visual studio only then go to view ---> Terminal ---> Select gitbash
3. If you enter wrong URL while pushing to github then we can set using below command
    "git remote set-url origin <url of the repository>"
4. If git is not configured in the github account yet, Still developers can start writing their
   code in the VS until git is ready and later they can push it to the git
5. A normal folder will become git when you initialize by using command "git init"
6. We develop code (or) script in VisualStudio
7. Using gitbash client we push the code (or) script to the github repository
8. Create a t2.micro server in AWS
9. git clone <URL> in the server ---> Because we are cloning for the first time
   cd <name-of-shellscript>
   "sh <script-name>"
   git pull ---> If you want only changes
   echo is only used for printing purpose

01-hello-world.sh
------------------
Sample hello world script

02-variables.sh
----------------
Dry concept don't repeat yourself, We can give variables in capital letters but not mandatory, for calling a variable give "$" , What ever you add the changes first push it to the github then pull from the server
 
03-variables.sh
----------------
How do you run commands in shellscript and take output ? ${command}, Usage ===> DATE=$(date)
echo "script started executing at ${DATE}"

04-variables.sh
----------------
We can give arguments outside the shell. Usage ===> "sh <script-name> ram raheem"

05-variables
-------------
For example if we want to connect to any external systems like DB we need username and password, 
if we give username and password outside the shell everybody can see that. So to make confidential
we have "read command"

06-data-types.sh
-----------------
Int,float,string etc. In shellscript data type is not much important, it will automatically consider which data type is. Usage in server ---> "sh <script-name> 100 200"

07-arrays.sh
-------------
Array index will start from 0,1,2,3.... we have notation for "ALL" that is "@"

Points to remember
*******************
1. If you make any changes in the code in VS if you save that changes by pressing ctrl+S then colour 
   will change to yellow.So to make normal then you must push the code to the github account
