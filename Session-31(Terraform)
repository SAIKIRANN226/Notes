In this session we have created below resources using terraform code instead of creating manually in aws.
- VPC 
- Internet Gateway
- Public, Private and Database subnets
- Database subnet group since database has different behaviour
- Elastic_ip
- NAT Gateway
- Public, Private, and Database route tables
- Added Public, Private, and Database routes
- Public, Private, and Database route table associations

# How to refer terraform module in github? ---> source = "git::<https URL>ref=main

Points to remember
*******************

  like VPC or SG etc.
- In this class we continue from creating database subnet.
