1. If it is a small project every resources will be in one folder like sg.tf,vpc.tf etc. If it is a 
   big project then we can keep resources in separate folders(repos) like "roboshop-infra-dev",
   refreshing time will be longer if we put all resources in one folder.

2. Create remote root directory in the "Node server" in home-location(CD) because centOS doesnt have
   sudo access in the /var/lib/jenkins location. "mkdir jenkins-agent". So path would be in the below
   /home/centos/jenkins-agent

3. Go through the Jenkinsfile in 01-vpc in roboshop-infra-dev

4. Create ROBOSHOP(anyname) folder in jenkins UI and add VPC in this folder as pipeline project,
   script path should be "01-vpc/jenkinsfile", Similarly do for other infra also just for practice

5. ERROR:: Terraform command not found because it is running in the agent and agent dont have 
   terraform, So we need to install few tools in node server, if you are using ony master then install 
   it in master only like "terraform command(install terraform linux in google) and "aws credentials" 
   also(just "aws configure" in server while configuring aws do not configure through root user because 
   master is connecting using centos it is not taking the sudo access, master may not know everything 
   but agent should know everything because agent will only work here, However the logs will be showed 
   in the jenkins-master but the running will be in nodes

6. To enable colours we have "ansiColor" Plugin keep ansiColor('exterm') in the options aswel as 
   install plugin in the jenkins console also manage jenkins/plugins/available plugins, make sure to 
   restart jenkins to enable colors

7. Jenkins pipeline when with parameters search in google, That means overall we can write CICD for 
   infra also like vpc,sg,vpn etc.

8. To create accesskey and secretkey go to the SecurityCredentials from the profile/users/click on 
   your user(saikiranuser)/make sure delete old keys and create new keys and download the csv file
   for future reference, because secretaccess key will be only showed once.
   
CICD, should we keep infra ready to create CICD for applications? Project infra should be ready what 
are the project infra ? like vpc,sg,vpn,databases,app-alb,acm,web-alb etc. which ever are long term 
that are project infra whichever are short term those are application infra, So before CICD for 
applications we need to keep project infra ready, So now we should do CICD for catalogue, for that we
should have
1. Catalogue application should be in git and 
2. Write a jenkinsfile for this

CI (Continous Integration)
***************************
1. Clone then code
2. Unit testing
      scans like sonar scans
3. Install dependencies
4. Build ---> zipfile
5. We need to push to the nexus

Continous Integration is nothing but whenever developers pushes the code to the git continously, we should take the code and compile,build,scan,unitesting,and saving artifacts, If CI success then only we should go for
CD

CD (Continous Deployment)
**************************
6. Deploy to Dev environment
7. Functional test cases
8. Publish the results

1. Create one catalogue repo and keep the catalogue code in this folder 
2. Refer Catalogue folder in VS. package.json and server.json is the main code of
   catalogue and write a Jenkinsfile for this catalogue and refer "Jenkinsfile.bkp"
















Declarative pipeline is more simplified than scripted pipeline
